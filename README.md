simple-steganography
====================

Simple Steganography is a basic but completely functional GUI Java tool for image steganography.

This tool works on the concept of modifying the two least significant bits of the Blue value of a pixel. I created this software for my college summer project.

>> Use the program from Start.java, or run the executable JAR file "simple_steganography"

Project was created with Eclipse 4.4 Luna. In case you intend to use the software with anohter IDE or simply with CUI, adjust location of background image files accordingly.
